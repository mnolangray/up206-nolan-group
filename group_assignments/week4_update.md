# Week 4 Update
Please find the project proposal [here](https://github.com/mnolangray/up206-nolan-group/blob/main/README.md).

## Roles
Not applicable: this is a solo operation. (Probably wasn't such a great idea.)

## Status Update
To be honest, I will need to put a lot of time into this in the coming week. I haven't done much outside of what you (the teaching team) has already seen.

## Data Update
Chris generously shared some data on the characterstics of LA homeless and some of the literature on vehicle dwelling.

I have all the data that I need for [overnight parking districts](https://github.com/mnolangray/up206-nolan-group/blob/main/data/LADOT%20Overnight%20Parking%20Districts.geojson) and [preferential parking districts](https://data.lacity.org/Transportation/LADOT-Preferential-Parking-Districts-PPD-/2ckn-xmjp). I need to combine these two data sets and spend some time reading more of the literature on the political economy of parking district adoption.

I need to spend some time on two mapping components: First, mapping vehicular homelessness by census tracts. This at one point [existed](https://graphics.latimes.com/homeless-los-angeles-2015/)—I just need to find it. Second, mapping safe parking sites and their space capacity. I know this [exists](https://storymaps.arcgis.com/stories/400d7b75f18747c4ae1ad22d662781a3)—I just need to retrieve it. 

## Concerns
* Will not be able to find useful/recent datasets for vehicular homelessness by Census tracts (major)
* Developing a mental model of the intersection of vehicular homelessness, parking policy, and socioeconomic factors (major)
* Have not done enough work on this up until now (minor)
* Declining mental health (minor)
