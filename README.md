# Propject Proposal
## Introduction 

For this quarter, I would like to better understand the use of Overnight Parking Districts (OPDs) as a form of anti-homeless policy. Specifically, I would like to better understand the interaction of observed patterns of vehicle dwelling, the adoption of OPDs, the location of safe parking sites, and neighborhood socioeconomic characteristics. 

## Why It Matters
Los Angeles is in the grip of an ongoing housing shortage, which has in turn resulted in ever rising rents and home prices. As a result, an estimated [66,000](https://laist.com/news/homeless-increase-los-angeles-2020) Angelenos are homeless; of this population, approximately [16,000](https://www.latimes.com/local/lanow/la-me-homeless-safe-parking-los-angeles-20190610-story.html) sleep in their car. While “vehicle dwelling,” as participants refer to the practice, is a marked improvement over street homelessness, it nonetheless leaves the person at risk of crime and police harassment and with limited access to basic services. Over the summer, I briefly joined their ranks, a lifestyle choice that started as an experiment and ended as a necessity. 

While those who are entirely without shelter often receive the bulk of the attention—perhaps rightly so—the vehicle-dwelling homeless receive relatively little recognition or assistance from the state. The city’s policy toward vehicle dwellers thus far has overwhelmingly been to criminalize the practice, banning vehicle dwelling in various quarters. Key to this strategy has been the adoption of OPD districts, which ban overnight parking on many public streets and further escalate the risk of criminal penalties. Recognizing that simply pushing around this vulnerable population accomplishes little, the city has recently started to pilot safe parking sites, which provide vehicle dwellers with a safe, legal, and well-serviced place to park.

This paper attempts to sketch out this phenomenon, with special attention paid to the factors driving the option of OPD districts. 

## Spatial Scope

The spatial scope of this particular project is Los Angeles. In the future, I hope to study the statewide adoption of similar prohibitions on overnight parking and oversized vehicles. 

## Data Sources

There are four big piece of data:
* A [census tract](https://censusreporter.org/data/table/?table=B19013&geo_ids=16000US0644000,140|16000US0644000&primary_geo_id=16000US0644000) map of Los Angeles, to which I can join ACS data covering median household income, population density, racial breakdown, and share of households without a car, among other possible variables.
* A map of existing [Overnight Parking Districts](https://data.lacity.org/Transportation/LADOT-Overnight-Parking-Districts/jk9n-burj), and if I can find it, a map of over oversize vehicle prohibitions.
* A map of existing safe parking sites. I don’t believe this exists, but it wouldn’t be too much trouble to make it, as there are only [six](https://www.lahsa.org/news?article=592-safe-parking) currently in operation.
* Recent [homeless count](https://geohub.lacity.org/datasets/homeless-count-by-council-district-2019/explore?location=33.807914%2C-118.298788%2C8.68) data. Earlier iterations distinguished whether the person counted was a vehicle dweller. I should see if they are still collecting this data but simply not releasing it. 

## Analysis and Visualizations

This project will have three major components:
1. A background survey of the history of vehicle dwelling and policy responses in Los Angeles.
2. An analysis tying the four factors discussed above to each census tract and test for relationships. For example, do socioeconmic factors predict the adoption of an OPD? Do high rates of vehicle dwelling help to explain the siting of safe parking areas? 
3. Maps illustrating patterns of vehicle dwelling and the location of safe parking sites and various relevant overnight and oversized vehicle parking districts.

## Conclusion

My hope in undertaking this work is to lay the groundwork for further study of the reemergence of vehicle dwelling in Los Angeles and other California cities. Furthermore, I hope to develop a deeper understanding of the quiet misappropriation of parking policy toward exclusionary ends.
